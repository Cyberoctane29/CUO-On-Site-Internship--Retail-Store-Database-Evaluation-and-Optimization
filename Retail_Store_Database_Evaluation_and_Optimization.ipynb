    "This project is based on my database and SQL internship, where I focused on evaluating and optimizing a music store database. The primary objectives were to refine the database structure, improve query performance, and ensure data integrity. The database encompasses essential components of a music retail system, including customer details, inventory information, and transaction records. Throughout the project, I applied theoretical concepts of database management to a real-world setting, working extensively with MySQL and PostgreSQL environments."

    "  * A detailed review of the data types for each column was conducted to ensure that the database design was optimized for storage and retrieval efficiency.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * I examined the existing SQL queries and identified areas where query performance could be improved.\n",
